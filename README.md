## Project Overview

This repository contains two primary files:

**test_tasks.js:** This file includes detailed step-by-step implementations of the tasks, along with `console.log` statements to help visualize the intermediate steps and results. It serves as a development and debugging aid, providing insights into how each function operates internally.

**tasks.js:** This file includes the final versions of the functions in both traditional and arrow function formats. The functions are implemented in a clean and concise manner, suitable for production use.

## File Descriptions

**test_tasks.js**

* **Purpose:** To aid in development and debugging.
* **Description:** Contains comprehensive `console.log` statements to display intermediate results, allowing for step-by-step tracking of the computation process. This approach ensures that each function performs as expected during development.

**tasks.js**

* **Purpose:** To provide the final, production-ready versions of the functions.
* **Description:** Contains optimized implementations of the required functions in both traditional and arrow function formats. This file excludes the `console.log` statements to keep the code clean and efficient for production use.

## Functions Implemented

* Halve a Number: Halves a given number.
* Multiply Two Numbers and Add 3: Multiplies two numbers together and adds 3 to the result.
* Count Halves to Less Than Ten: Calculates how many times 1000 needs to be halved to be less than 10.
* Remove Above a Given Number: Filters an array to remove values above a specified limit.

## Why This Approach?

* **Separation of Concerns:** By splitting the tasks into two files, we maintain a clear separation between development/debugging and production-ready code.
* **Clarity and Maintainability:**  This file includes the final versions of the functions in both traditional and arrow function formats. The functions are implemented in a clean and concise manner, suitable for production use.
* **Versatility:** Providing both traditional and arrow function formats in Tasks.js showcases different ways to achieve the same functionality, highlighting the flexibility and modern features of JavaScript.

## Usage


* **test_tasks.js:** Use this file during development to understand the step-by-step execution of each function.

* **tasks.js:**  Use this file for deploying the final, optimized versions of the functions.
